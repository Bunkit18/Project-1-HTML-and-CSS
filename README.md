# **TielBible**

TielBible is a compact site full of specialised information that aims to provide potential, new and long-time owners of the Cockatiel parrot with as much necessary information to keep their parrot happy and healthy, as well as alleviate any stress by providing answers to common questions that may concern or confuse owners.

* ## Site Structure 

    TielBible is comprised of seven pages, with [Home](index.html) being the default loading page. The pages are as follows: [Variation](variation.html), [Behaviour](behaviour.html), [Diet](diet.html), [Vet Locations](vet.html) and [Contact](contact.html).

    There is a pop-up form in the footer of every page which, alongside the form in the contact page, will lead to the [Thank You](thankyou.html) page. Longer pages have a fixed 'return-to-the-top' button on the right-handside for ease of access to the header and navigation bar.

# Design

* ## Colour Scheme

    The colour scheme was initially determined through two cockatiel colour palettes found on [Google](https://www.google.com): 

    Palette #1 :

    ![Cockatiel Palette 1](assets/images/Cocktiel-colour-scheme.png)

    Palette #2 :
    
    ![Cockatiel Palette 2](assets/images/Cocktiel-colour-scheme2.png)

    After deciding to take on board palette #2, I trialed various colour compositions on the site, before deciding to use only 3 of the colours in the palette, with 3 differing hues of two of the colours, which I found with [colour-hex.com](<https://www.color-hex.com/>). 

    My final colour scheme was therefore:

    ![TielBible Palette](assets/images/palette.png)

    This palette was chosen to be personal to the common cockatiel colouration while also adding in saturated hues to stand out be more visually striking.

* ## Typography

    Using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), I matched up my preferred font style for TielBible and decided on Roboto Condensed n regular 400 as a header font, and Nunito for lesser headers and paragraphs in Extra Light 200. This had a clean and condensed look, with the Roboto font being a popular choice for fonts in website design. 
    
    Both used sans serif as a fallback font in the event that either chosen font doesn't load.
