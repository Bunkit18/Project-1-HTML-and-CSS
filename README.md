# **TielBible**

TielBible is a compact site full of specialised information that aims to provide potential, new and long-time owners of the Cockatiel parrot with as much necessary information to keep their parrot happy and healthy, as well as alleviate any stress by providing answers to common questions that may concern or confuse owners. 

TielBible will provide information on the different colour variants, gender determination, behaviour, diet and exotic / avian vet locations in the United Kingdom.

# Design

* ## Site Structure 

    TielBible is comprised of seven pages, with [Home](index.html) being the default loading page. The pages are as follows: [Variation](variation.html), [Behaviour](behaviour.html), [Diet](diet.html), [Vet Locations](vet.html) and [Contact](contact.html).

    There is a pop-up form in the footer of every page which, alongside the form in the contact page, will lead to the [Thank You](thankyou.html) page. Longer pages have a fixed 'return-to-the-top' button on the right-handside for ease of access to the header and navigation bar.

* ## Colour Scheme

    The colour scheme was initially determined through two cockatiel colour palettes found on [Google](https://www.google.com): 

    Palette #1 :

    ![Cockatiel Palette 1](assets/images/Cocktiel-colour-scheme.png)

    Palette #2 :
    
    ![Cockatiel Palette 2](assets/images/Cocktiel-colour-scheme2.png)

    After deciding to take on board palette #2, I trialed various colour compositions on the site, before deciding to use only 3 of the colours in the palette, with 3 differing hues of two of the colours, which I found with [colour-hex.com](<https://www.color-hex.com/>). 

    My final colour scheme was therefore:

    ![TielBible Palette](assets/images/palette.png)

    This palette was chosen to be personal to the common cockatiel colouration while also adding in saturated hues to stand out be more visually striking.

* ## Typography

    Using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), I matched up my preferred font style for TielBible and decided on Roboto Condensed n regular 400 as a header font, and Nunito for lesser headers and paragraphs in Extra Light 200. This had a clean and condensed look, with the Roboto font being a popular choice for fonts in website design. 
    
    Both used sans serif as a fallback font in the event that either chosen font doesn't load.

* ## Imagery

    My hero image is an image of a standard grey cockatiel, the most common colour variation as detailed in my site. The image was sourced from [pixabay](https://pixabay.com/), where a lot of TielBible images were sourced from. It was the ideal image for my hero image to present the site topic most clearly and in the most emotionally impacting and stiking way.

    Other images in TielBible have been influenced or sourced by the following websites:

# Features

TielBible was created with ease of navigation in mind. A navigation bar is included in the header for all pages, with clear titles of the context of the information provided in each page. Each page, if required, has clearly defined links to each sub-section. Pages are designed to be simple and have an overarching structure through pages to ensure the site is easy to use and navigate.
    
All pages are responsive for other viewports, such as tablets and mobiles. The structure of the page doesn't differ in different viewports.
