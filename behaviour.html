                    <h2>Behaviour</h2>
                    <p>Cockatiels, as one of the smaller members of the parrot family, with the intellect of a two-year-old child, are mighty personalities in tiny feathered bodies! But most new cockatiel owners (and even some long-time owners) can struggle in interpreting what their body language and vocal calls mean.</p>
                    <p>Cockatiels can communicate in various ways, whether that be their crest (head feathers), their chirps (or calls) and even their body language and expressions! They're more than capable of displaying their emotions, whether happiness, tiredness or discomfort. </p>
                    <p>In this section, we will be looking into: </p>

        <div id="crest-up-text">
            <h3 class="underlined">Crest</h3><br>
            <p>The crest of a cockatiel is incredibly useful in telling a cockatiels mood, as the cockatiel themselves will adjust it according to what their feeling! It's important to note that while helpful, you should always look into other factors to get a clearer picture, as there is a limited amount of states or positions for a cockatiels crest, and therefore some positions can be similar to others with completely different meanings!</p><br>
            <p>For the most part, the available states are: <a href="#full-up" class="link">Fully raised</a>, <a href="#up" class="link">Relaxed raised</a>, <a href="#half-down" class="link">Half down</a> and <a href="#full-down" class="link">Fully down</a>.</p><br>
            <div id="full-up">
                <h4>Fully Raised</h4><br>
                <p>The crest will be as vertically straight as possible. The fully raised crest can have two possible meanings: Curiousness or Alerted.</p><br>
                <p>The only way to distinguish between a curious bird and an alert bird is to pay careful attention to other aspects of their body language. A curious bird will usually slightly tilt their heads towards the target of their curiousity, sometimes fully extending the neck. An alert bird shares one of these signs, in that it too will full extend their neck, however the most crucial difference is that an alert birds whole bodily feathers will lay flat on their skin, appearing to be very thin and rigid. Either bird should be approached slower than usual so as not to startle them, which could either cause a little nip from their beaks out of surprise, or a full fledged panic flight, where the tiel will fly erratically and speedily in laps around the room. Upon rest, the cockatiel will be panting and out of breath.</p><br>

        <div id="up">
            <h4>Relaxed Raised</h4><br>
            <p>The crest will be raised, although not perfectly straight. Often, cockatiels who have a long enough crest will have some slight curling at the end of their crests. This is usually an indicator of a cockatiel being relaxed or contented. Regardless of the meaning, both are very similar emotions and are positive, so there is no need to pay attention to other features. However cockatiels which are relaxed or contented may appear slightly puffed up, with the feather beside their beaks slightly covering it and eyes may appear wide open and clear.</p><br>

        <div id="half-down">
            <h4>Half Down</h4><br>
            <p>The crest is half down in a somewhat relaxed way. This is usually a sign of tiredness in cockatiels and can be accompanied by other forms of behaviour alongside that, such as one foot tucked up, yawns, and tucking their heads into their wings at the back.</p><br>

        <div id="full-down">
            <h4>Fully Down</h4><br>
            <p>The crest is completely against their head. This has two possible meanings: Anger or Happiness. This emotion can be properly reviewed depending on other bodily expressions. An angry cockatiel will usually slightly open their beaks at their target and crouch slightly lower to the ground. An angry cockatiel isn't to be approached without consequences, as a painful bite can easily rear its head. A happy cockatiel will show the same flat crest but the tip of their crest may be slightly curled up. This is more often seen in male cockatiels and accompanied by chirping, singing, or slightly open wings, known as "heart wings".</p><br>
            <p>As a small addition, this can also be a temporary sign when offering food to a cockatiel, which is a genetic inherited body language baby birds develop when being fed when young. This will stop once the item being offered is either taken or removed from nearby.</p><br>

    <section id="calls">
        <h3 class="underlined">Calls</h3><br>
        <p>Understanding a cockatiels behaviour and mood brings their calls into consideration. Their calls or the sounds they make can help determine their sex, their mood and even what they are doing when out of sight! Males tend to be more vocally active than females of the species, but this rule doesn't always apply, as rarely some females are also known to sing or mimic human speech!</p><br>
        <p>Theres a lot of different sounds cockatiels make and can be a source of confusion or concern for a new cockatiel owner, so in this section we will explore some of those sounds to promote knowledge of basic cockatiel sounds and alleviate any potential concerns of to-be or new cockatiel owners.</p><br>
